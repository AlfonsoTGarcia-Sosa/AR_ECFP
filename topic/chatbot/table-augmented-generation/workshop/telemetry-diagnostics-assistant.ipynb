        "- Built a natural language interface with an LLM to convert plain English into CrateDB-compatible SQL queries.\n",
        "- Visualized time-series data directly from natural language questions, bringing clarity to trends, outliers, and anomalies.\n",
        "- Generated structured machine manuals, complete with thresholds, anomaly rules, and emergency procedures.\n",
